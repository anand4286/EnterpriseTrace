# Requirement Traceability Matrix System

This is a TypeScript-based requirement traceability matrix system that generates interactive dashboards from OpenAPI specifications.

## Project Overview
- **Type**: Full-stack TypeScript application
- **Purpose**: Generate requirement traceability matrix from OpenAPI specs
- **Features**: Interactive dashboards, test integration, CI/CD pipeline
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions to OCP4 environment

## Architecture
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Testing: Playwright for API and UI testing
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes/OpenShift

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements - TypeScript-based RTM system from OpenAPI specs
- [x] Scaffold the Project - Created comprehensive project structure with backend, frontend, and tests
- [x] Customize the Project - Implemented all core features including API endpoints, dashboard, services, and tests
- [x] Install Required Extensions - No specific extensions required
- [x] Compile the Project - Successfully built TypeScript backend, frontend dependencies installed
- [x] Create and Run Task - Development and production tasks configured
- [x] Launch the Project - Ready for launch with dev scripts
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete - Comprehensive README and documentation created

## Project Status: COMPLETE âœ…

The requirement traceability matrix system has been successfully created with:

### âœ… Completed Features:
1. **Backend API** (TypeScript + Express)
   - OpenAPI specification parsing and validation
   - Traceability matrix generation
   - Dashboard data services
   - Test management endpoints
   - Swagger API documentation

2. **Frontend Dashboard** (React + TypeScript + Material-UI)
   - Interactive project dashboard
   - Component health monitoring
   - Test coverage visualizations
   - Responsive design

3. **Sample OpenAPI Specifications**
   - Simple e-commerce API
   - Complex banking API with advanced features

4. **Testing Framework** (Playwright + Jest)
   - API integration tests
   - UI component tests
   - End-to-end workflow tests
   - Test case generation from OpenAPI specs

5. **CI/CD Pipeline** (GitHub Actions)
   - Automated testing and building
   - Security auditing
   - Docker image creation
   - OpenShift deployment (staging and production)

6. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Kubernetes/OpenShift manifests
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Environment-specific configurations

7. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guides
   - Sample usage examples

### ðŸš€ Ready to Use:
- Development environment setup
- Production deployment pipeline
- Interactive dashboard
- API endpoints for requirement traceability
- Test automation framework
- Sample OpenAPI specifications for testing

The system provides end-to-end traceability from requirements to API endpoints to test cases, with metrics and reporting similar to ReportPortal.io.
